Yellow is the color of the light and the sun. It is optimistic and cheerful, seeing the good in the world. Yellow
cards are often about healing or protecting your minions.

## Example Yellow Cards

[[Nexi Trebuchet Team]]

Nexi Trebuchet Team is a pretty great attacker, since it has 4 power and first shot when attacking. This means it is
primarily an offensive card, not a defensive card. Since it is a 3 cost yellow Human minion, you can level up an
Eager Apprentice into it, if you are looking to transition to a more aggressive stance.
