# Multicolor

> You are remembered for the rules you break.
> <cite>Douglas MacArthur</cite>

Multicolor cards go beyond a single color. They have more than one color in their energy cost, so you need to have ways to generate both colors of energy to play them. Their effects are often aligned with more than one color and would not be possible with just a single color.

When energized, multicolor cards do not contain enough of a single color to generate energy of any color, so they can only generate colorless energy. This means that you will need to compliment multiccolor cards with monocolor cards in order to generate the energy you need for your multicolor deck.

## Example Multicolor Cards

[[Personal Tutor]]

Personal Tutor is a multicolor minion that requires both yellow and black to play. Its entrance ability allows you to replace a minion you control with a better minion. For full rules on how Level Up works, see the [Glossary](/wiki/rules/glossary).

[[Unbound Radical]]

Unbound Radical is a yellow and red minion that helps you create more Spark Jar tokens. Spark Jar tokens can be used to increase an action card's damage or an elemental card's power by 1. For more information on Spark Jar tokens, see the [Glossary](/wiki/rules/glossary).
