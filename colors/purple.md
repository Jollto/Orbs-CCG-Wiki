# Purple

> Solitude, isolation, are painful things, and beyond human endurance.

Purple is the color of the underground, of solitude, of the Velk, and of stonework. Some Purple cards derive benefits when they're the only one in play. Purple has many constructs, including the Golems, who are animated construction minions made of stone.

## Example Purple Cards

[[Secretive Spy]]

Secretive Spy is a nice way to gain cards when it attacks and is unblocked. It can also be used to filter cards out of your hand, since its activated ability will make it unblockable, at the cost of discarding a card.

[[Cave of the Recluse]]

Cave of the Recluse is a location that can be used to make your single minion stronger. You only get its benefit if you have no other minions in play, so it is best used in a deck that is focused on having only one minion in play at a time.
