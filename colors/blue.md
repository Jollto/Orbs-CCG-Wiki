# Blue

> The sea has never been friendly to man. At most it has been the accomplice of human restlessness.

Blue is the color of water and the seas. Its magic can harness the power of small crab, or the power of the tides
and waves themselves. Many a mage has travelled to the Mystic Seas in search of arcane power, yet few have returned.

## Example Blue Cards

[[Refresh]]

Refresh is an interesting card because it can be used as a trick to unexhaust a minion, to block incoming attacks as
a surprise. If you don't need it at that time, you can either invoke it (which will get you a new card) or just energize it away.
