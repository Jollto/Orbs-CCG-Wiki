# Black

> The beginnings and ends of shadow lie between the light and darkness and may be infinitely diminished and infinitely increased. Shadow is the means by which bodies display their form. The forms of bodies could not be understood in detail but for shadow.
> <cite>Leonardo da Vinci</cite>

Black is the color of death, evil, and wickedness. It is the color of the night, of the undead, of demons, and of necromancers. Beware the power of black, for it can be a dangerous force to reckon with.

## Example Black Cards

[[Hungry Ghoul]]

Hungry Ghoul's ability lets you gain cards from minions or secrets you no longer want. For example, you can convert 1/1 Insect minion tokens into a new card. Or if one of your own minions is about to die to something like Execute, you can instead liquidate it for a new card.
