# Objects

Objects are one of the basic card types in the game. They are permanents that are placed on the field and can have
interesting static or activated abilities.

## Objects to Know

Here are some objects that illustrate how object cards work.

[[Capturing Mirror]]

Capturing Mirror can banish an opponent's minion when it comes into play. This can be a useful removal tool, but if you
lose the Capturing Mirror, your opponent will get their minion back.

[[Golem Arms]]

Golem Arms has an activated ability that you can use during your turn to give one of your minions +2/+2 until the next
clear. (Clears happen at the end of each turn in live play, and after your defensive battle in async play.)

[[The Orb of the Pack]]

The Orb of the Pack is a powerful object that gives all of your minions additional power and health based on how many
other minions of their subtype you control. For example, if you have four Insect minions, they would each get +3/+3.

It also has Coveted, which means if you ever take battle damage, your opponent gains control of it. You can get it back
by dealing battle damage right back to them.
