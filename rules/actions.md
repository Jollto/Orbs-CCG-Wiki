# Actions

Action cards are one of the basic card types in the game. They are one-time use cards that can have a variety of effects. By default, an action card can be played during your turn, outside of the battle phase, and only if there's nothing on the stack. However, if the action card has the Nimble ability, it can be played at any time.

## Actions to Know

[[Execute]]

Execute will destroy any target minion. It can be used at Nimble speed, so watch out!

[[Gifts from Above]]

Gifts from Above draws two cards. That's it. It's a simple card, but don't underestimate the power of card advantage to get ahead.

[[Sun God's Wrath]]

Sun God's Wrath is a powerful action card that destroys all minions in play. This can be a great way to clear the board if you're behind.
