# Minions

Minions are one of the main card types in Orbs CCG. Minion cards represent a character with power and health that can be played to the playing field to attack and defend. The full health of a minion represents its initial health, and when it takes damage, its health is reduced. When a minion's health reaches 0, it dies. A minion's health resets to full health (i.e. damage is removed) at the end of each Clear step, which happens at the end of each turn in live play. In asynchronous play, the Clear step happens immediately after defending against an attack, before your first main phase.

## Minions to Know

[[Agnu's Hellraisers]]

Agnu's Hellraisers is a powerful minion card that can be played for 5 energy and attack the turn it comes into play (since it has the [Speedy](./glossary.md#speedy) ability). If you already attacked that turn, you can instead play it for 4 energy, since it's second ability makes it cost less if you've already attacked.

[//]: # 'something something remember in async play you don't have second main phase so you can't cast it cheaper later?'

[[Gentle Dryad]]

Gentle Dryad is a minion card that can be played for 3 energy. While its ability to return an energizer to your hand looks like a downside, it's optional, so you don't have to do it. However, there are many times you will want to return an energizer to your hand. For example, if you have Energizing Rabbit, then returning an energizer to your hand might be a good way to make your minion larger. Further, if it's the late game, and you want one of your energizer cards back so you can play it again, then you can return it to your hand.

[[Sola's Enforcer]]

Sola's Enforcer is a minion with the [Flyer](./glossary.md#flyer) ability, meaning it can only be blocked by other minions with [Flyer](./glossary.md#flyer) or the [Range](./glossary.md#range) ability. This makes it a great way to get damage through to your opponent. It also has the ability to grow larger (activate only once per turn) which can help it deal more damage. Even if you don't activate the ability, the threat of activation can make your opponent play differently, for example by not blocking.
