# Glossary

Some cards have abilities that are denoted by keywords. These keywords have a specific meaning and are used to make the card text shorter and more readable. The following is a list of keywords and their meanings.

## Boost Counters

**Boost counters** are a type of counter that can be placed on a minion. They give the minion +1/+1 for each Boost counter on it.

![Meditating Monk with 2 Boost counters](/wiki-assets/cards/meditating_monk_boost_counters.png)

The Meditating Monk card gets a Boost counter whenever you gain health. This lets the minion get stronger as the game progresses. Normally Meditating Monk is a 2/1, but with 2 Boost counters as in the above picture, it becomes a 4/3. Boost counters are represented by a number in the top right corner of the card.

## Coveted

At the end of battle, if you were dealt battle damage and control a permanent with the **Coveted** keyword, your opponent gains control of that permanent.

[[The Orb of Destruction]]

## Flyer

A minion with the **Flyer** keyword can only be blocked by other minions with the Flyer keyword or minions with the Range keyword.

[[Mystic Pelican]]

## Health Hitter

A minion with **Health Hitter** gains health for its controller when it deals damage. This is a great way to keep yourself alive while attacking your opponent! If you are being attacked by a Health Hitter, you may want to block it rather than try to outrace it, since it is difficult to beat an opponent who is gaining health every turn.

[[Magus of the Light]]

## Invoke

When you **invoke** a card, you play it from your hand. The card is then put on the stack as an invocation. The card is not considered to be in play until the invocation resolves, which in live play requires both players to pass priority. In async play, just the player whose turn it is needs to pass priority. If you have the auto-pass after invoking my own cards setting enabled, you will not need to manually pass priority after invoking your own cards, since the game will do it for you.

Some cards may be able to target an invocation on the stack. This is a way to interact with cards that are not yet in play. For example, Interfere can _negate_ an invocation on the stack.

## Level Up

When you **level up** a minion card, you search your deck for a minion card with energy value 1 or 2 greater, whose colors and subtypes are a superset of the original minion's properties. The new card replaces the old one. If you didn't find a card, instead put 2 Boost counters on the original minion.

[[Eager Apprentice]]

For example, Eager Apprentice, a yellow Human that costs 2 total energy, can level up into Nexi Trebuchet Team (it costs 3 total energy, is yellow, and a Human) or Avian Lightbearer (it costs 4 total energy, is yellow, and Human). It couldn't level up into a card that costs 5 or more energy, or a card that is not yellow or Human.

[[Avian Lightbearer]]

Note that colorless cards can level up into any card of the appropriate energy cost and subtypes, regardless of the color, since colorless is not a color.

## Nimble

Cards with **Nimble** may be invoked at any time. This means that, during live play, they may be invoked during an opponent's turn, during battle, or even while another card or ability is on the stack. For async play, while you do not manually take any game actions during an opponent's turn, your **Nimble** Secrets will auto-invoke themselves if their timing condition is met.

[[Mind Goblin]]

Mind Goblin is a good example of a card with the **Nimble** keyword. It can be invoked at any time, even during your opponent's turn.

[[Tree Nuts]]

If you have a Mind Goblin in play and another **Nimble** card in the hand, such as Tree Nuts, invoking that card during your opponent's turn will let you draw a card with Mind Goblin's triggered ability. Mind Goblin + Tree Nuts = synergy!

[[Nocturnal Kraken]]

Note that all activated abilities have the normal timing restriction that prevents them from being invoked during an opponent's turn, during battle, or while another card or ability is on the stack. Some abilities have the **Nimble** keyword, which allows them to be used at any time. For example, Nocturnal Kraken has two abilities, the first of which can only be used with non-Nimble timing, while the second can be used at any time your have priority.

## Permanent

A **permanent** is a card that remains in play after it is invoked (invoked means it is played). Unlike action cards, it is not discarded at the end of the turn. Minions, objects, energizers, and secrets are all permanents.

## Range

A minion with the **Range** keyword can block minions with the Flyer keyword.

[[Ageless Hyperion]]

## Search Your Deck

When a card instructs you to search your deck for a card, you may look through your deck and take the card you want. After searching your deck, you always shuffle it. You may choose not to find a card if you wish.

[[Campaign Recruiter]]

Campaign Recruiter is a good example of a card that lets you search your deck to find Knight cards.

## Spark Jars

**Spark Jars** are a type of token that can be used to improve the next non-battle damage you'd deal, or an Elemental's power. They are created by various cards, such as Spark Prospector. The Spark Jar token is considered to have subtypes Elemental and Construct, and has the ability: "Liquidate: add 1 to your next non-battle damage or target Elemental minion's next battle damage." The Spark Jar's ability is Nimble, meaning it can be used at any time.

If you want to use a Spark Jar's ability, you must do so before the damage is dealt. Once the damage is dealt, it would be too late to activate the ability.

Spark Jars are also Speedy, meaning they can be used the turn they are created.

[[Spark Jar Token]]

## Speedy

A permanent with **Speedy** can attack and use abilities that require exhausting the turn it enters play. (Normally only energizers can exhaust the turn they enter play.) For example, Agnu's Hellraisers can attack the turn it enters play.

[[Agnu's Hellraisers]]

## Unblockable

An **Unblockable** minion cannot be blocked by an opponents' minions.

[[Sneaky Knight]]

While **Unblockable** is different from not being able to block yourself, Sneaky Knight has both.

## Unique

Cards with the **Unique** keyword cannot be invoked if you already control another card with the same name. You can still energize the card, however. **Unique** cards represent one-of-a-kind characters or items, typically with a unique name.

[[The Mother Tree]]

## Unlimited

A deck may contain any number of cards with the **Unlimited** keyword.

[[Go To Hell]]
