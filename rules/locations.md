# Locations

Locations are one of the card types in the game. Like objects, location cards do not participate in battles, but they 
can have a variety of effects on the game. Currently, there can be at most one location in the game at a time. If 
another location card would enter the playing field, the current location is placed in the graveyard.

## Homelands

Some locations have the Homeland subtype. This is a special subtype that allows the player going second to start with
that location in play at the start of the game. This is a nice bonus for the player going second, as normally they
have a disadvantage.

## Future Development

There's more planned for locations in the future, however they involve more complexity and hence
have been left for future development. For now, here is a teaser: the rule about one location being in play
at a time may change in the future to allow for multiple locations.
