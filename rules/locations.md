# Locations

Locations are one of the card types in the game. Like objects, location cards do not participate in battles, but they can have a variety of effects on the game. Currently, there can be at most one location in the game at a time. If another location card would enter the playing field, the current location is placed in the graveyard.

The locations in the game at present are not generally powerful enough that you want to play them from your hand. Instead, you should energize them if you happen to draw them. It's recommended that decks contain 1 - 3 locations, depending on the deck's strategy.

## Homeland

Some locations have the Homeland subtype. This is a special subtype that allows the player going second to start with that location in play at the start of the game. This is a nice bonus for the player going second, as normally they have a disadvantage.

## Future Development

There's more planned for locations in the future, however they involve more complexity and hence have been left for future development. For now, here is a teaser: the rule about one location being in play at a time may change in the future to allow for multiple locations.
