# Secrets

Secrets are one of the card types in the game. Cards with the Secret ability can be [invoked](./glossary.md#invoke) (played) face-down as a Secret for {2C}, then later [invoked](./glossary.md#invoke) from a Secret for its Secret cost.

Additionally, some Secrets have the ability to be invoked from a Secret for a special Trap cost when their Trap conditions are met. During asynchronous play, these Secrets will automatically be invoked when their Trap conditions are met, even during an opponent's turn.

## Secrets to Know

[[Interfere]]

Interfere is an Action card that can be invoked as a Secret, then later invoked from a Secret. Its ability will negate another card on the stack, meaning that card will go to the graveyard without resolving.

[//]: # 'graveyard mentioned here and a couple other places, but does not explain zones'

[[Hidden Dragon]]

Hidden Dragon is a Minion card that can be invoked as a Secret. Additionally, its ability makes it grow larger for each Secret you control.

[//]: # 'if casted with secret, is it already on battlefield and can attack same turn? or secrets are invoked not on battlefield?'
