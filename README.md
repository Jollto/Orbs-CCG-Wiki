The objective of the game is to reduce your opponent's health from 30 to 0. You typically do this by attacking with 
minions, dealing enough damage to your opponent to reduce their health to 30. You could also use action cards to deal 
direct damage to your opponent. There are many different strategies you can use to win the game, and the best players
are able to adapt their game plan as the game progresses.
