# Deckbuilding

Orbs CCG is a collectible card game where players bring their own pre-built decks to play with. This means that 
players can build their decks to suit their playstyle and strategy. The following explains the rules for deckbuilding in Orbs CCG.

## Deck Size

For constructed play, a deck must contain exactly 50 cards. For limited play, a deck must contain exactly 40 cards. If
you are playing with a limited card pool, and have fewer than 40 cards available, you will be provided with 40 copies
of the Empty Vessel card to fill out your deck.

## Deck Editor

Use the deck editor to build your deck. Click cards from your collection on top to put them into your deck on bottom.
You can filter your collection to find the cards you want to add to your deck.
