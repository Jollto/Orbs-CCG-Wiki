# Async Play

Asynchronous (async) play means playing the game without the need for both players to be online at the same time. This allows players to play the game at their own pace, taking turns when they have time to do so. This can be more convenient for players who have busy schedules or live in different time zones.

## How it Works

In async games, players may only take actions during their own turn. Once you end your turn, your opponent will be notified that it is their turn to play. This means if it is not your turn, you can go about your day without needing to be at your computer to respond to your opponent's actions. They will then be able to take their turn whenever they have time to do so, and once they end their turn, you'll be notified that it's your turn again.

The phases of the game are different during async play. Instead of the normal phases of the game, async phases happen in the following order:

1. **Opponent's Battle Phase**: Unlike live games, in async games, turns start by finishing the battle phase started during the preceding turn.
2. **Clear Phase**: Damage and temporary effects reset at the end of the clear phase. This means if your opponent uses a card that temporarily pumps their minion during their turn, it will reset at the end of the clear phase, allowing the effects to last through the entire battle.
3. **Main 1 Phase**: Play cards, attack, and use abilities.
4. **Battle Phase**: Attack with your minions.

The turn then ends in the middle of your battle phase.
