# Battle

Battles are the main way of dealing damage to an opponent. During a battle, first the attacking player declares which minions, if any, they are attacking with. Then the defending player declares which minions, if any, they are blocking with (and which minions they are blocking). Multiple blocking minions can block a single attacking minion, if the defending player chooses. The minions then deal damage to each other, and any minions that have taken damage equal to or greater than their health are destroyed. Any unblocked damage is dealt to the defending player.
