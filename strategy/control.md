# Control

## What is a control deck?

A control deck wants to control the field first by destroying opponents minions, negating their invoked cards, and eventually
having the largest and strongest minions on the board. Control decks are typically slower than aggro decks, but they can be
very powerful in the late game.

[[Sun God's Wrath]]

Control decks might play cards like Sun God's Wrath, an action card that can destroy all minions. If you know your
opponent is playing this card, you might think twice before playing all your minions out. Hold some back just in case!

[[Interfere]]

Interfere is a secret that can negate another card on the stack. This can be used by control decks to stop their opponent's
big plays.
