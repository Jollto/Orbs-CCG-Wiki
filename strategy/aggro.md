# Aggro

Aggro decks are some of the most aggressive decks in the game. They are designed to win the game as quickly as possible by dealing damage as soon as possible. Aggro decks are usually very fast and can win the game in just a few turns. Aggro decks are typically made up of low to the ground inexpensive minions and direct damage action cards.

[[Dragonrider]]

Dragonrider is the type of card that an aggro deck would want. It is a 1-drop minion with 3 power, which is very strong in your opening hand. It also has the ability to get the Flyer ability later in the game, if you control a dragon. This can help you get damage through to your opponent, even if they have a lot of minions on the field.
